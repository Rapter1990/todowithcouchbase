 * A class representing the pagination information for a request.

 * This class ensures that the page number and page size provided by the user meet the minimum constraints.
 * The page number is expected to be 1-based, but internally it is converted to 0-based indexing.
 *
 * @see #getPageNumber() for how the page number is adjusted.
